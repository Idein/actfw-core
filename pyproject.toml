# This library is intended to be used to implement [Actcast application](https://actcast.io/docs/ForVendor/ApplicationDevelopment/).
# Dependencies should be compatible with those provided by apt in Actcast application's base image
# to prevent installing different versions.  Notice that, IIUC, there is a possibility that
# `actdk build` (and `pip install`) on Raspberry Pi 3 installs a binary distribution for ARMv7 in
# spite of the application is intended to support Raspberry Pi Zero, which is ARMv6.  Using apt
# (for non-pure python packages) mitigates the problem.
#
# The table of current versions provided by apt:
#
# |                      | Raspberry Pi | Jetson Nano |
# | -------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
# | pithon3-pil (Pillow) | 5.4.1        | 5.1.0       |
#
# For example, the version constraint of python package `Pillow` should be `^5`.
